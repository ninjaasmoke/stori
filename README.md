# ðŸ“š stori
* Have you ever had a book that you no longer needed?
* Have you ever wondered how you could exchange that book for another book?

## You no longer need to worry! âœ‹

**stori** is here.  

stori lets you add books to your wishlist or a *having_books* list. Then automatically searches for people who are in need of a book that you have, or have a book that you need or **both**.   
   
Then you can exchange books, with other books or money!   

**Strike a great deal for both parties and enjoy with your new book or *money*!**

## How it works âœ¨
Stori is developed with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) & [Dart](https://dart.dev/).   
Stori uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication & cloudstore as a database.   

* In the backend, **stori** creates a database of users and stores them in Firebase,
* Then, you (the user) can add books you like or have to their respectice lists.
* These books are given an unique ID and can be accessed & edited at any time.
* **stori** searches for people who have similar interests in books as you and shows the people who are closest to your current location.
* You can then, meet up with them, have a cuppa coffee & exhange your books!
